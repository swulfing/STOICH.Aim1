SITECODE,FIELDNAME,FROM_DATE,TO_DATE,DATETYPE,CONTINUING,DESCRIPTION,
T04,ALKY,19-Feb-97,26-Mar-97,R,N,Lack of correlation with Ca questions validity. Insufficiant sample to repeat alkalinity test. Ca verified through repeat analysis. Refers to all sample date during peiod 19/2-26/3 inclusive.,
T04,,03-Feb-99,03-Feb-99,D,N,Relatively low total N concentration in ECN QC sample; suspect incomplete digestion of sample,
T04,,30-Jun-99,30-Jun-99,D,N,QC Fe - very high concentration confirmed by repeat analysis - Fe analytical run validated by two laboratory QC samples that were within expected limits.,
T04,IRON,04-Oct-00,15-Nov-00,R,N,ECN QC Fe concentration relatively high - investigation currently taking place,
T04,,05-Jul-00,27-Dec-00,R,N,ECN Anion 99 was used.  ECN Cation 2000 was used.,
T04,,04-Jun-08,04-Jun-08,D,N,"Site confirmed high pH, even on QC sample.",
T04,,04-Mar-15,04-Mar-15,D,Y,New aqc 2015,
T04,,14-Oct-15,14-Oct-15,D,N,pH done first before conductivity,
T04,,23-Sep-15,31-Dec-99,R,Y,New acid solution from chemistry from now on,
T05,,23-Jun-04,24-Nov-04,R,N,"23-Jun-04, 07-Jul-04, 28-Jul-04 and 24-Nov-2004 - filtration date unknown but logged with the same date as pH analysis as the lab usually do them both on the same day.  At the latest filtration is done the day after pH.",
T06,,19-Jul-06,19-Jul-06,D,N,Possible contamination of QC CATION sample during dilution to 1% therefore values not included,
T08,,20-Jan-05,28-Apr-05,R,N,"The preparation date for the QC solution for the rest of the determinands has  been entered as the date of the solution for the anion analysis, another solution was made for the cation analysis.  The date analysis was completed has been entered for when the last determinand  was analysed - the anion and cation analysis completion dates are usually different.",
T08,,16-Nov-06,16-Nov-06,D,N,"QC date entered as 16-Nov-2006, but could have been any date between previous/next cation analyses 8-Nov-2006 and 5-Feb-2006.",
T09,,02-Oct-02,09-Oct-02,R,N,High nitrate still high on repeat,
T09,,25-Jun-15,25-Jun-15,D,N,QC's for NH4 from other QC samples in same run OK,
T11,,28-Jan-98,31-Dec-08,R,N,Anion pH/conductivity is potentially erroneous until 2009 when misinterpretation of the guidelines was corrected,
